		<h1>Resume</h1>
	
		<p>While studying industrial design at the University of Illinois, I landed a couple UX internships and I loved the mix of design, business, art, technology, and collaborating with engineers. I worked at <a href="https://www.deere.com/en/">John&nbsp;Deere</a> for a few years before leaving for <a href="https://nutrienagsolutions.com/agrible">Agrible</a>, an ag tech startup. A year later we were acquired by Nutrien and I spent nearly three years integrating our technology into the larger enterprise.</p>

		<p>I shifted gears and started working for a health and fitness startup, <a href="https://www.flatsorspikes.com">Flats or Spikes</a>. Around that time, I began consulting and had a blast working with companies like <a href="https://sunbasket.com">Sunbasket</a>, <a href="https://vineify.com">Vineify</a>, and <a href="https://www.writerduet.com">WriterDuet</a> to build their design systems.</p>

		<p>Now I’m back with John&nbsp;Deere as a UX design lead. I get to work on projects relating to autonomous and electric vehicles and lots of fun stuff.</p>
