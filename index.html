    <h1>Hi, I’m Andrew Haglund.</h1>

    <p>
    	I live in Urbana, IL, and work as a UX lead at John&nbsp;Deere.
    	I love to build furniture, play Nintendo, futz on the piano, and go on dog walks.
    	I studied industrial design at the University of Illinois and previously worked at Flats or Spikes, Nutrien, and Agrible. Follow me on <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@haglund">Mastodon</a> or <a href="/contact">contact me</a> to say hello.

    <h2>Furniture</h2>    
		<p>
			Before jumping into work, how about woodwork? I enjoy making furniture by hand, joined without screws or nails.
