	<h1>MapKeep Privacy Policy</h1>
	
	<p>We take your privacy seriously. The only data that leaves the app goes to iCloud for syncing, which is governed by Apple’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/icloud/us-en/terms.html">iCloud privacy policy</a>.</p>
	
	<p>MapKeep accesses your device’s location to save and display items within the app. Access to this location data is handled by standard operating system privacy prompts.</p>
	
	<p>Other than syncing with iCloud, no personal data leaves your device. Unless you email me for support, I have no information about you or the location data saved using the app.</p>
	
	<p>– Andrew</p>
	
	<h2>Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
	
	<p>MapKeep does not gather or transmit any Personally-Identifying Information outside of your local device. It stores locations in its local database and syncs using iCloud.</p>
	
	<h2>Business Transfers</h2>
	
	<p>If MapKeep, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that MapKeep goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, this policy and its effects may change or be amended. (As MapKeep does not collect any information about you there is very little effect this would likely have in practice.)</p>
	
	<h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
	
	<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, MapKeep may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and at MapKeep’s sole discretion. Your continued use of this app after any change in this Privacy Policy with constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
	
	<h2>Indemnity</h2>
	
	<p>You hereby indemnify us and undertake to keep us indemnified against any losses, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, legal expenses and any amounts paid by us to a third party in settlement of a claim or dispute on the advice of our legal advisers) incurred or suffered by us arising out of use of this app or any breach by you of any provision of these terms of use, or arising out of any claim that you have breached any provision of these terms of use.</p>
