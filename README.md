# About this repo
This is the code source of my personal website [haglund.app](https://haglund.app). It’s a static website with basic HTML/CSS and supports Dynamic Type and Dark Mode on Apple devices. (To be honest I have *no idea* how it looks on Android or Windows devices.) I want the site to load instantly so there’s zero javascript or tracking.

# Goal
Show some of my work as a user experiece designer, resume, side projects, and link to my other presences on the web.

# History
After more than 10 years of paying Weebly for its half-assed WYSIWYG editor and inaccuarate analytics, I decided to learn HTML/CSS and build a new website myself. With more than a decade of analytics I learned (a) very few people visit my site* and (b) most just check out the homepage and that’s about it — so keep it simple.

*I am _more_ than OK with this.
